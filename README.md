# NgxDynamicHeadings

A library to help you use dynamic headings in your angular app. 

Build your angular component, then use `<ngx-dynamic-heading content="Hello, World!"></ngx-dynamic-heading>` and your heading level will generate automatically based on where it is in the app.  

## Development server

Run `npm run dev` to run a development server. This app is used as a playground to experiment with the **ngx-dynamic-heading** lib
